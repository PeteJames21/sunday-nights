I am a writer with a passion and obsession for reading novels, historical, and some idealistic books🤔. I see art in almost everything around me. People's dressing... the way food is served and garnished on plates...graphiti on walls...🥰 and it can go on and on... I believe everything has a story to tell. Whether alive or not 😌. We only see it differently individually,... I may write some of your feelings, thoughts, or insights...😉. I pray God walks this journey with me 🙏😌
