A beauty most pristine that made the roses blush
Of timbre most surreal that made the angels hush
Her smile most radiant, the stars in their courses dull
A soul most serene, the waves from their torment lull

Maiden most divine, of your life may I ever be part
Yea, from age to age, ever enshrined in your heart.
