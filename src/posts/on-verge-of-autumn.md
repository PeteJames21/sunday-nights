Sultry heat
A tad bit softened
But concrete is still burning
With rays of summer
Trees are getting ready
For autumn
A radical discoloration
A jaw-dropping
Transformation
That would leave
The world
Wide-eyed
With a slight melancholy
Teasing the thoughts
Change is coming
Are you ready for change
A whisper cuts the air
Like a new knife
Are you ready to let go
The question drops
From nature's lips.
