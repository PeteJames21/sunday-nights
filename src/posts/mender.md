A poet once killed a man,
And all gathered to watch him hang
The sole poet, noose in neck
A death fitting for his life
Just before they hanged him
They wondered whoâ€™d tell their tales
Of their miseries and victory
They cast their eyes around
And saw there were too many cobblers
So, they grabbed one and hanged instead
A mender of soles
For a mender of souls
A bargain fit for an elegy
