You made that night my best,
Under the shade of a leafless true,
We stood out among the rest,
With sweet laughs of love,
Lovingly we strolled abreast,
The world we owned and ruled.
As lips tangled here and there
The shy stars blushing and bursting
I felt the world stop a bit
And the showers of a dream
Indeed, in love we wondered
