I am but a caterpillar
surrounded by butterflies
such beautiful creatures
I have watched many like me change
change with such grace into such beauty
I often wonder why
why I am yet to find such grace
why am I yet to change into such beauty
have I done something wrong
I want to change
but yet I am stuck being such a horrid creature
a caterpillar
I want to be a butterfly
I want to have wings
so I can spread them and fly
fly in the beautiful sun light
fly and be free in the light
