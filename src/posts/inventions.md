Transmute; she said
Is when one thing becomes another,
A stranger to a friend
Or a man to a father
Evening t night and so on;
Hence, I understood,
Thet nature moves in gradual steps
And one thing becomes the next
Always keeping in that order,
Its only the illusions of disorder
That keeps us inventing words
