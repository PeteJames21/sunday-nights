When the storm gathers
And the sun is hidden from view
With cold piercing winds –
And dark omnibus shadows:
Mothers rush to take the babes in
The chickens, the goat and al
Sensible creatures take cover
As the clods clatter and bang
And all outside is deserted
We, we come out to play
As the rain soaks us
The tears, Lord the tears
We’ve been holding back
Flow
