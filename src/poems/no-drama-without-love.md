She said she loved him
Just here for the drama
He hurriedly replied
No drama without love, said she
Have no time for one, said he
Like you and I, said she
The two together twine
Or like old age and wine
Do love and drama go
Maybe in the summer
or the season without glamour
Only the drama, said my mama
Tragedy is love and drama
The tune of the village drummer
Said he the son of a farmer
