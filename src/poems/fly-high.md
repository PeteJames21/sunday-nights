Free as a bird, no chains, no ties,
Drifting through endless, open skies.
No map to follow, no path too steep,
Just the windâ€™s whisper and skies so deep.

No weight to carry, no clock to chase,
Just open air and boundless space.
Storms may come, the winds might change,
But a bird keeps flying wild, unchained.

It seeks, it finds, it gives, it stays,
A rhythm of life in simple ways.
No rulers, no borders, no fear, no shame,
Just wings that move with no need for a name.

So be like a bird let go, take flight,
Trust in the sky, embrace the height.
See like an eagle, sharp and wise,
Rise with the sun, get lost in the skies

Fly high
