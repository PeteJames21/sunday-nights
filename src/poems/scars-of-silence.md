I wear a mask to hold in place
A painted smile upon my face;
But underneath this outer shell,
Lies hidden deep an inner hell
Each whispered word- a silent plea,
Yet no one sees the ghost in me.
My head is filled with endless thoughts
Some battles won, but this one's lost

The blade I hold inside my hand
Carries the weight of what I planned
But darkness awakens an endless night;
What once was wrong now feels so right.
Every cut brings fleeting peace,
An aching heart demands release.
With every drop that stains the ground,
A shattered thought; no solace found.

A map of pain etched on my skin,
To show the struggles from within
With every line, with every scar
I wonder if I've gone too far
"Keep looking forward" they always say
But hope is lost at the end of the day
What guides us through the darkest dawn?
What light remains when hope is gone?

So here I stand at life’s dark gate,
With weary hands I contemplate:
To sever ties with fleeting breath—
To slip away from life and death.
