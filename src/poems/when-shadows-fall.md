When dark shadows fall around me
When the day turns into night
I am safe within His keeping
For He draws me to His side.

Ever faithful through the fury
Through the fire and through the flood
I am trusting as He guides me
Ever faithful through His love.

Looking back, I see more clearly
And my heart will not forget
All the ways His grace has kept me
He has never failed me yet.
