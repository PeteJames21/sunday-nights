He was a mountain,
A lion; but to us
A tuft of wool

He’d thrust me up
Like a flightless bird
Back to him I fell
Taught me kindness and pride
In the works of one’s hand

He knew when to lift me up
When to let me fall
He sharpened my teeth
And let me bite
‘Till my bite was hard enough!
Now his steel hands are weak
And the day I left home
Tears in his eyes
Mama in his hands
He said,
You can always come home

Whenever I go back
He kills the fattest calf
And embraces me with work beaten hands
He is a man and a half
He is my father
