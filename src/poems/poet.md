He spits on the face of the gods;
And still they sing his songs
Our stories; tears and hurt,
Are fodder for his craft.
What we whisper in shame,
He sings his way to fame.
Many men are born,
But forgotten once gone,
But poets â€“ joy they bring
With their words that sing
I want to be a poet
Said a boy I know!
