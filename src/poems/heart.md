Roll on, keep walking, dear heart,
I pray you don’t fall for those who want you not,
In their name you will fight darkness and doom
As they watch from vantage points
As you bleed, they will call you weak
Dragging you through the mud
They will trample you like dust
Heart; don’t hold the world on your shoulders
Shielding those who couldn’t
Hold a breath for you.
Roll on, keep walking, dear heart!
