He walks the path, feet light, yet sure,
Balancing life on rails obscure.
The sun hums soft in golden tones,
A fleeting warmth he calls his own.

Illusions dance, they pull, they sway,
Yet he won’t let them lead astray.
His mind's too sharp to take the fall,
He sees right through, he knows it all.

The world may trick, the world may turn,
But wisdom grows with lessons learned.
He plays the game, he makes the calls,
He stands his ground he never falls.

For he is James, and James won’t break,
He walks the line for his own sake.
