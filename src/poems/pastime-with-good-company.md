Pastime with good company
I love and shall until I die.
Grudge who lust, but none deny,
so God be pleased, thus live will I.
For my pastance
hunt, sing, and dance.
My heart is set:
all goodly sport
for my comfort,
who shall me let?

Youth must have some dalliance
of good or ill some pastance.
Company me thinketh then best –
all thoughts and fantasies to digest.
For idleness
is chief mistress
of vices all.
Then who can say
but mirth and play
is best of all?

Company with honesty
is virtue – vices to flee.
Company is good and ill,
But every man hath his free will.
The best ensue,
the worst eschew.
My mind shall be;
virtue to use,
vice to refuse,
Thus I use me!
