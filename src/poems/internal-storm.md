When the silence gets too loud
Old wounds start to bleed
Your demons are exposed
And start to feed
Chest tightens. Breaths get faster.
Heart races.
I can't breathe.
"You're worthless."
The voices echo.
There's no hope.
Nowhere to run but home.
Where can I hide?
Where I can hide once more
To calm the silence
