She's a beauty in a broken place,
Wearing strength behind her face.
Planned to leave, but stayed instead,
With battles fought inside her head.

Heart of glass, but still she stands,
With pearls and scars in both her hands.
An angel walking through the pain,
A quiet message in my brain.
She's the realest thing I've ever known.
