On my travels up above,
I picked up a star,
Wrestled it from its place,
And dragged it down below.
Its one thing to watch stars above,
Its another to hold them in hand.
For they burn like Sulphur;
And are big like mountains!
Day and night I gave my all,
But it was never to be,
Until I let go â€“
And I was left below
Hence, I learnt it all,
Its only a star if its far!
