They ran around as they chuckle 
Joy fills their heart 
The doors to her soul takes their sight in
She wishes she like them.
 
She had her chance,
Regret fills in her in her trance,
I should have enjoyed it 
while it lasted.
But it's long gone,as fated.

She only hoped that her joy would come back,
No longer knowing how to bring back her joy,
But her joy had gone without looking back.

It was time she took control of her fate,
No longer leaving it in the hands of others.
It was a chance for her to write her own story.
If only she would realise.
