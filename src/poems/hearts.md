Hearts don’t fix in perfect lines
they curve, twist, and break again
before the light finally enters.
I walked a crooked path
hoping the pain would forget my name,
but it walked beside me like an old friend.
Yet somewhere between the cracks,
I grew wings made of the hurt.
Healing wasn’t straight
but it took me higher
To places I never saw
But it hit me like a raw 
Drove me away from where I was 
For I am afraid of the worst 
But the worst is now nursed
