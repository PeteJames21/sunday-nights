Safe in your arms,
your heartbeat feels like a melody—
sweet, steady, certain.

My fingers trace its rhythm
along your chest,
learning you without words

Kisses pressed on my forehead,
gentle and sure.

In a moment meant only for us,
as the day fades into night,
the world falls away.

Passion and love become one,
and I can't tell
where your warmth ends
and I begin.
