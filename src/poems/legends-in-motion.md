Always, always, keep moving,
Even when the world stands still.
Keep moving, traffic only watches
Legends in motion, chasing the thrill.

Eyes may glare, voices may shout,
But forward is where the brave will go.
The parked will comment, the idle will doubt,
Yet legends in motion forever flow.

Always, always, keep moving,
Through chaos, noise, and commotion.
For the road belongs to the bold and proving
Traffic only watches legends in motion.
