Demons dance where none have seen,
A haunting waltz, a silent scream.
A mask of smiles, a cloak of light
Just to convince them I'll be alright

In shadowed corners, secrets keep
A heavy heart that cannot sleep.
The weight of thoughts, so extreme
I'm living in a fading dream.

Beneath the surface my heart feels tight
In depths unseen, I drown in the night,
Gasping for air, in the darkness I hide.
Concealing the storm that rages inside.

Each breath a burden, a muted sigh
Life keeps going, passing me by
If I can't go forward, I'm left behind
Crushed by the weight of my own mind

Surrendering to the endless pain
I'll free my soul from these chains
Suffering in silence, I finally give in
Then the struggle ends and peace begins
