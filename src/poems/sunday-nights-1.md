Where whispers hum in soft delight,\
Fine nights bloom, a tranquil sight,\
Finding might in fleeting time,\
A melody spun from careless chimes.

Coins of thought, like stars, align,\
Casting dreams in a silver shine.\
In every note, a spark, a gleam,\
Life unfolds in a vivid dream.

Let the rhythm of hope entwine,\
Through every heart, a steady climb.\
Tranquil nights, where spirits rise,\
A hymn of courage under endless skies.
