We are not just survivors,
patched up with scars and silent battles.
We are architects,
laying bricks of hope on the ruins of yesterday.

We are not just wanderers,
drifting where the wind may take us.
We are seekers,
chasing truths that hide beyond the horizon.

We are not just dreamers,
lost in the haze of what could be.
We are builders,
shaping tomorrow with calloused hands and stubborn hearts.

Carved by storms, shaped by fire,
we have bent but never broken.
And though the road behind is long,
the road ahead is longer still.

We stand.
We rise.
We are not done.
