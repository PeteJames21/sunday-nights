Standing at a cliffâ€™s edge
Far into the sea I see
The ancient breeze drawing close
Rippling the bare sea
Gently it stings my eyes
Swooshes over me with grace
With the sound of a howling wolf-
And the scent of salt and blue.
Slowly I lose my balance,
In the thrill, I part my lips
The tasteless wind gushes in
With a whizzing whisper-
I call your name!
