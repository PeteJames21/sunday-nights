We jumped the fence, no time to think,
Landed hard near a muddy brink.
Smelled like cow dreams, damp and raw,
But freedom hit us like a roar.

We crawled through thorns, we bit our lips,
Took every blow, survived the slips.
The past was heavy, the nights were cold,
But hope’s a fire that won’t be told.

And now we stand where green things grow,
Where winds are soft and rivers flow.
We paid the price, we bear the fee
But we’re alive.
And we are free
