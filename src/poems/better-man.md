Where i would have fallen,
Now I only stumble
To the brother I would have struck
I suffice with an insult

I am yet to turn the other cheek
Or take a brother the extra mile
It may only have been yesterday
When I was worse off than today.

But I hold close a quiet pride
That as the sun sinks and rises
I am a better man -
a small step at a time
