In his talk about *The Surprising Habits of Original Thinkers*, [Adam Grant](https://youtu.be/fxbCHn6gE3U) discusses the results of a research in which it was discovered that procrastinators tend to have more creative and original ideas than those who get the job done way ahead of time. He attributes this to the fact that putting an idea in your mind and failing to act on it immediately gives you more room to ruminate on it and improve it. However, procrastinating does not necessarily make one more creative. There appears to be a "sweet spot" between overprocrastinating and getting the job done too early. Procrastination is good for creativity but hurts productivity. A healthy balance must be found.
